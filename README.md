## Why This Exists

You're prepping for a gig and realize you have 47 versions of "One More Time" and half your tracks show as "!" because you reorganized your music folder. This tool handles those two problems: duplicate detection and track relocation.

I'm aware of commercial tools like Rekordbox Collection Tool (RCT) by MixMasterG, but it's macOS-only and closed source. This is free and cross-platform.

**The common pain points:**
- Duplicate tracks with slightly different names cluttering your library
- Missing file references ("!" tracks) after moving your music folder
- Spending more time organizing than mixing

---

## What It Does

### Duplicate Detection
- **Audio fingerprinting**: Finds identical tracks even with different filenames
- **Metadata matching**: Compares artist, title, BPM, key — configurable
- **Confidence scoring**: Shows how certain the match is
- **Flexible settings**: Adjust thresholds to suit your library

### Track Relocation
- **Smart search**: Automatically finds moved music files
- **Similarity matching**: Matches tracks even when filenames differ
- **Bulk operations**: Fix hundreds of missing tracks at once
- **Unlocatable tracking**: Marks tracks that couldn't be auto-relocated for manual review

### Resolution Options
- **Quality-based**: Keeps the highest bitrate version
- **Date-based**: Keep newest or oldest files
- **Folder preferences**: Prioritize tracks from certain directories (e.g. FLAC over MP3)
- **Manual mode**: Review everything yourself

### Session Persistence
- Picks up where you left off if you close the app
- Uses IndexedDB (no external database needed)
- Results are stored per-library

## Quick Start

### Download & Install

#### Option 1: Pre-built App (Recommended)

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/koraysels/rekordbox-library-fixer/releases)
2. Download the right file for your system:

**Windows:**
- `Rekordbox.Library.Fixer.Setup.x.x.x-alpha.exe` — installer (recommended)
- `Rekordbox.Library.Fixer-x.x.x-alpha-win.zip` — portable

**macOS:**
- `Rekordbox.Library.Fixer-x.x.x-alpha-universal.dmg` — works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
- `Rekordbox.Library.Fixer-x.x.x-alpha-arm64.dmg` — Apple Silicon only (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- `Rekordbox.Library.Fixer-x.x.x-alpha.dmg` — Intel only (pre-2020 Macs)

> **Not sure which Mac you have?** Click the Apple menu > About This Mac. If it says "Intel" under Processor/Chip, use the Intel DMG or the universal one. If it says "Apple M1/M2/M3", use the arm64 or universal one.

**Linux:**
- `rekordbox-library-manager-x.x.x-alpha.AppImage` — universal AppImage
- `rekordbox-library-manager_x.x.x-alpha_arm64.deb` — Debian/Ubuntu

3. Install and launch

#### macOS: Opening an Unsigned App

Since this app isn't signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS may warn you about it. The `xattr` command in Terminal removes the quarantine flag:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Rekordbox\ Library\ Fixer.app
```

Alternatively, right-click the app and choose **Open**, then click **Open** in the dialog that appears.

#### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koraysels/rekordbox-library-fixer.git
cd rekordbox-library-fixer
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Using the Tool

#### Step 1: Export Your Rekordbox Library

1. Open Rekordbox
2. Go to **File → Export Collection in xml format**

   ![Export Menu](screenshots/export-collection-as-xml.png)

3. Save the XML file somewhere easy to find (e.g. Desktop)
4. Large libraries (10,000+ tracks) may take a few minutes to export

> **Tip**: Export your library regularly as a backup — the XML contains all your playlists, cue points, and track metadata.

#### Step 2: Load Your Library

**Drag & Drop:**
1. Launch Rekordbox Library Fixer
2. Drag your XML file onto the app window

<img src="screenshots/06-drag-drop-library.png" alt="Drag and Drop" width="600" />

**Browse:**
1. Launch the app
2. Click **Browse for XML File** and select your file

#### Step 3: Find Duplicates

1. Go to the **Duplicate Detection** tab
2. Configure detection settings (optional): audio fingerprinting, metadata fields, path preferences
3. Click **Scan for Duplicates**
4. Review the grouped results

#### Step 4: Resolve Duplicates

1. Review the duplicate groups
2. Select duplicates to resolve (or **Select All**)
3. Choose a resolution strategy:
   - **Keep Highest Quality** — keeps best bitrate
   - **Keep Newest** — most recently modified
   - **Keep Preferred Path** — prioritizes specific folders
   - **Manual** — review each pair yourself
4. Click **Resolve Selected** and confirm

#### Step 5: Relocate Missing Tracks (Optional)

If tracks show as "!" in Rekordbox:

1. Go to the **Track Relocator** tab
2. Add search directories where your music might be
3. Configure search depth and similarity threshold
4. Click **Scan for Missing Tracks**
5. Review candidates and apply the relocations you want

#### Step 6: Import Back to Rekordbox

**Enable XML import in Rekordbox:**

1. Open Rekordbox
2. Go to view preferences and enable **"rekordbox xml"** in the Tree View

<img src="screenshots/import-xml-step-1.jpg" alt="Enable XML Import" width="600" />

**Import the cleaned file:**

1. Navigate to the **Database** tab
2. Select your updated XML file (saved with `_cleaned` suffix by the tool)

<img src="screenshots/import-xml-step-2.jpg" alt="Import XML" width="600" />

3. Keep **BPM change points** checked to preserve beatgrid data
4. Click **Import** and wait for processing

**Import playlists:**

1. In the left sidebar, find the **rekordbox xml** section
2. Right-click **Playlists** and select **Import Playlist**

<img src="screenshots/import-xml-step-3.jpg" alt="Import Playlists" width="400" />

**Verify:**
- Check playlist track counts are correct
- Confirm duplicates are removed
- Test that relocated tracks play

> **Backup reminder**: Before importing, back up your Rekordbox database:
> - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Pioneer\rekordbox`
> - macOS: `~/Library/Pioneer/rekordbox`

## FAQ

**Is this safe to use with my library?**
Yes. The tool creates backups before making changes. Your original files are never modified directly.

**Does it work with large libraries?**
Yes. Tested with libraries containing 50,000+ tracks. Uses IndexedDB (via Dexie.js) for performance and persistent storage.

**Can I undo changes?**
Yes. Every operation creates a backup XML file you can restore from.

**What about other DJ software?**
Currently supports Rekordbox XML format. Serato and VirtualDJ may be added if there's enough interest.

**Is it free?**
Free for personal use. No ads, no subscriptions, no limits.

---
